export const HERO_CONTENT = `With over 4 years of experience in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Proven ability to develop responsive user interfaces, implement efficient web solutions, and maintain high-performance web applications. Expertise in using frameworks such as Angular to build scalable, client-focused websites. Adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, resolving bugs, and optimizing UI/UX. Skilled in maintaining code quality and delivering projects on time, while continuously learning new technologies to enhance functionality and user experience.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `My journey in technology began with 2 exchanges that developed my programming, teamwork, and creativity skills. After these experiences, I worked as a Junior Front-End Developer, where I was responsible for daily maintenance, layout, and implementation of the Vtex platform on e-commerce sites, serving clients such as Stance and other retailers.

Subsequently, I interned in IT Development at Banco ABC Brasil, where I contributed to the development of internal systems by resolving bugs and handling requests for existing systems. This experience gave me practical insight into the software development lifecycle and allowed me to contribute by developing user interfaces with Angular, implementing business logic via APIs using .NET and C#, and creating database procedures with SQL Server.

Currently, I am a student of Science and Technology and Computer Science at the Federal University of ABC, where I continue to enhance my knowledge in new languages and tools.

I have been involved in managing the student representation of the Green Team Hacker Club, an ethical hacking group formed by UFABC students, where I developed interpersonal skills and held roles such as Vice-President and President.

My goal is to combine my practical experience with a solid academic background to tackle complex challenges in the technology field. I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow professionally and apply my knowledge to innovative projects.`;

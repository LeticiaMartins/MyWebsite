export const ABOUT_TEXT = `My journey in technology has been shaped by a variety of experiences that allowed me to learn and grow. It began with two exchange programs, where I had the chance to develop my programming, teamwork, and creativity skills while gaining new perspectives.

Currently, I'm a student of Science and Technology and Computer Science at the Federal University of ABC, where I'm continually learning new tools, languages, and concepts. Alongside my studies, I've been part of the Green Team Hacker Club, an ethical hacking group at UFABC. Serving in roles like Vice-President and President taught me the value of collaboration and leadership in a team environment.

My goal is to combine my practical experience with a solid academic background to tackle complex challenges in the technology field. I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow professionally and apply my knowledge to innovative projects.`;
